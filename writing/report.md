#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

#TODO

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 #TODO


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 #TODO


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


 #TODO




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

The sequence from 2005 seems to be the least similar, the sequence from 2006
the second most similar, and the seuqnce from 2007 the most similar.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?

It is hard to tell with such a small study, but it does seem that human
adaptation could be occurring slowly because the sequence from 2006 which
affected humans is more similar to the sequence from 2007 than the sequence in
2008.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?

[2005 & 2006](images/2005_2006.png)
```
Length: 1776
Similarity:  1690/1776 (95.2%)
Gaps:          45/1776 ( 2.5%)
Score: 9435.0
```

 **2006 & 2007:**
 ```
 Length: 1776
 Similarity:  1731/1776 (97.5%)
 Gaps:          25/1776 ( 1.4%)
 Score: 9703.0
```

**2005 & 2007:**
```
Length: 1751
Similarity:  1681/1751 (96.0%)
Gaps:          20/1751 ( 1.1%)
Score: 9379.
